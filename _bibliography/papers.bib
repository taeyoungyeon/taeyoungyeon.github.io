  abstract     = { Despite advances in practical and multimodal human activity recognition (HAR), a system that runs entirely on smartwatches in unconstrained environments remains elusive. We present EdgeHAR, an audio and inertial-based HAR system that operates fully

on smartwatches, addressing privacy and latency issues associated with external data processing. By optimizing each component

of the pipeline, EdgeHAR achieves compounding performance gains. We introduce a novel architecture that unifies sensor data

pre-processing and inference into an end-to-end trainable module, significantly accelerating performance by 25x while maintaining

over 90% accuracy on 25+ activity classes. EdgeHAR outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of accuracy while running on the

smartwatch directly at 30 Hz for multimodal activity classification and 40 Hz for activity event detection. This research advances


edge-based activity recognition, realizing smartwatches' potential as standalone, minimally-invasive activity tracking devices.},
