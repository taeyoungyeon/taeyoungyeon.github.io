    <div class="highlight">
        <strong>Summary:</strong> WatchHAR does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data. All processing happens locally on your Apple Watch.
    </div>

    <h2>About WatchHAR</h2>
    <p>WatchHAR is a research demonstration app developed by the SPICE Lab at Northwestern University for academic purposes. The app demonstrates privacy-preserving human activity recognition technology presented at ACM ICMI 2025.</p>

    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p><strong>We do not collect any data.</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>No personal information is collected</li>
        <li>No usage data is collected</li>
        <li>No analytics or tracking</li>
        <li>No account creation or sign-in required</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Sensor Usage</h2>
    <p>WatchHAR uses the following sensors on your Apple Watch:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Microphone:</strong> Used only for on-device activity recognition. Audio data is processed in real-time on your watch and immediately discarded.</li>
        <li><strong>Motion Sensors (Accelerometer, Gyroscope):</strong> Used for detecting physical activities. All processing happens locally on your device.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Processing</h2>
    <p>All sensor data processing occurs entirely on your Apple Watch. The app uses machine learning models that run locally on your device. No data is ever:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Sent to any server</li>
        <li>Stored on your device</li>
        <li>Shared with third parties</li>
        <li>Used for any purpose other than real-time activity recognition</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Privacy by Design</h2>
    <p>WatchHAR is designed with privacy as a core principle. The app demonstrates that effective activity recognition can be achieved without compromising user privacy through on-device processing.</p>

    <h2>Research Purpose</h2>
    <p>This app serves as a demonstration of research conducted at Northwestern University's SPICE Lab. It is provided free of charge for academic and educational purposes.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>WatchHAR does not integrate with any third-party services, analytics platforms, or advertising networks.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>WatchHAR does not knowingly collect any information from anyone, including children under 13.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy.</p>
